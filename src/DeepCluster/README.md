# Deep Clustering

This package contains PyTorch implementation of method of unsupervised feature learning through clustering (Deep Clustering for Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05520?context=cs]. 

We apply the proposed method over the Cohortney partitions of sequences.
